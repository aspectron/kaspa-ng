## Features

This software incorporates the following functionality:
- Rusty Kaspa p2p Node
- Kaspa wallet based on the Rusty Kaspa SDK
- Rusty Kaspa CLI wallet
- BlockDAG visualizer
- Remote node connectivity

This project is built on top of and incorporates the [Rusty Kaspa](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa) core framework.

This software is ideological in nature with a strong focus on architecture and decentralization. It is a unified codebase tightly coupled with the Rusty Kaspa project. Fully written in Rust, it is available as a high-performance desktop application on all major operating systems (Windows, Linux and MacOS) as well as in major web browsers. It does not rely on any JavaScript or Web frameworks, which greatly strengthens its security profile. The Web Browser extension based on this infrastructure is currently under development.

You can find more information about this project at [https://aspectron.org/en/projects/kaspa-ng.html](https://aspectron.org/en/projects/kaspa-ng.html).

## Releases

- You can obtain the latest binary redistributables from the [Releases](https://github.com/aspectron/kaspa-ng/releases) page.
- You can access the official Web App online at [https://kaspa-ng.org](https://kaspa-ng.org).

## Building

To build this project, you need to be able to build Rusty Kaspa. If you have not built Rusty Kaspa before, please follow the Rusty Kaspa [build instructions](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/blob/master/README.md).

In addition, on linux, you need to install the following dependencies:

#### Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libatk1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev librust-atk-dev
```

#### Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install glib2-devel atk-devel gtk3-devel
```

Once you have Rusty Kaspa built, you will be able to build and run this project as follows:

### From GitHub repository:

#### Running as Native App
```bash
cargo run --release
```

#### Running as Web App
```bash
cargo install trunk
trunk serve --release
```
Access via [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)

While the application is a static serve, you can not load it from the local file system due to CORS restrictions. Due to this, a web server is required. This application is designed to be built with [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) and is served from the `dist/` folder.  This is a self-contained client-side application - once the application is loaded, the web server is no longer required.

#### Running Headless

Kaspa NG application binary can be started in 3 ways:
- `kaspa-ng` - starts Kaspa NG in the default desktop mode
- `kaspa-ng --daemon [rusty-kaspa arguments]` - starts Kaspa NG as a Rusty Kaspa p2p node daemon
- `kaspa-ng --cli` - starts Kaspa NG as a Rusty Kaspa CLI wallet

If you need access to the wallet in a headless environment, you can start Kaspa NG in daemon mode and then use the CLI wallet to access the wallet.

#### Solo Mining

You can use the following stratum bridge to solo mine with Kaspa NG: https://github.com/rdugan/kaspa-stratum-bridge/releases
In order to allow for mining, you need to enable gRPC interface in the Settings panel (*'Local'* if running the stratum bridge on the same machine, *'Any'* if running the stratum bridge on a different machine).
In the stratum configuration setup kaspa_address of the machine running Kaspa NG (`127.0.0.1` if local) and use `stratum+tcp://<stratum bridge ipv4 address>:(5555)`.
